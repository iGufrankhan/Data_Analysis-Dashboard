# Data_Analysis-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.
# Covid 19 Data Analysis (By creating Incractive Dashboard using Tableau)
The dataset used in this project contains comprehensive and up-to-date information on the global COVID-19 pandemic. It includes data on confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths from various countries around the world.

# COVID-19 Dashboard Project
## Project Overview
This project visualizes the global impact of COVID-19 using data analysis and interactive visualizations created in Tableau. The goal of this dashboard is to provide a clear and intuitive understanding of key COVID-19 statistics across different countries, regions, and trends. The project includes multiple interactive visual elements to explore and analyze various COVID-19 metrics in real-time.

# Key Features of the Dashboard
   -Global COVID-19 Map
    A geographical map showing the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide
    -COVID-19 Trend Line Chart
    A line chart showcasing the trend of confirmed COVID-19 cases over time.
